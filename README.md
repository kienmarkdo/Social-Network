# Social-Network
Mini version of a social network with a friends recommendation feature based on mutual friends.

The text files net1.txt, net2.txt, net3.txt, big.txt, and huge.txt each represent a social network where:
- the number on the first line represents the number of users in the network
- the numbers on the left column represent the ID of a user
- the numbers on the right represent the ID of said user's friend
- the IDs are sorted from lowest to highest

For example, 1 2 means user 1 is friends with user 2.

NOTE: big.txt and huge.txt contain a significantly larger number of users.

Concepts:
- Reference and memory management
- Algorithm analysis (searching and sorting)
- Multi-dimensional lists
- Files
